# MicroMet
# Description

Scripts to process raw Eddy Covariance data for estimation of evapotranspiration and for QA/QC of micrometeorology data.

Based on Visual Basic scripts from Clayton Lewis (Utah Division of Water Resources) that were transcribed from Fortran scripts written by Dr. Lawrence Hipps (Utah State University).


# Data preparation from datalogger
All high-frequency data should be downloaded, backed up, and converted with card-convert to a CSV array. 

# Data Processing Workflow
1. Process data on the fly using EasyfluxDL; Provide immediate data through UGS portal 
2. QA/QC processed data to see if it meets quality checks
3. Reprocess data manually, focusing on low quality datasets
4. Upload refined data to Ameriflux
